# Daily-Tracker
Refractor by Jonathan Knight 

Responsive work day event tracker.  You can click in the event cell on any row with an hour and a save button and click save to store that event in local storage for the browser then close the tracker and check it again later to see your event is still on the tracker.  A scrolling hour bar shows the client what hours and events have passed in gray, what are currently present or due in red, and what are coming up in green.

### Credits
Bootstrap, jQuery, WDN, W3Scools, Google, StackOverflow for many hours of reading and review and trial and error and Coffee beans. Big thank you to the instruction staff again reviewing class material and notes really helped me get over bugs when I was stuck. 

#### Notes
Came pretty close to giving up on this one until trying simpler methods with more code lines in the future would like to reduce functions size so the saving and geting of information from local storage could all be one function. Also learned not pulling an all nighter is vastly more beneficial than trying to blink code at 0300 felt like this pushed back my normal submission timeline but getting it in before the deadline so happy to get more sleep. 
TO DO List:
-Chase down cell padding on table rows, getting 12px of padding from the css somewhere or jQuery would like to narrow that down but turning it off makes the UI look worse in my opinion and I didn't like the way the Save buttons looked after bigger than 80x80px squares. 
-Would like to add a calendar function so you could store different days but there's probably better resources for that. 
-The example showed the color time bar only in the event box, I didn't like the way that looked from a UI appearance and changed it be the whole table row deliberately.
